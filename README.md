Machine learning project for TXST CS 4347/Kaggle Competition

This was forked from another repo, but all work done is original - the fork was done merely to obtain the dataset as we entered the competition after the
entry deadline, and thankfully someone had accidentally uploaded the entire dataset to Git, which is why this repo is forked - we forked the accidental upload so we could keep all the data in the repo.
